## 🏗️ Architecture

- **5 Nodes**: Independent processes implementing Paxos consensus
- **10 Clients**: Separate processes sending transaction requests
- **Communication**: TCP sockets for inter-node and client-node communication
- **Fault Tolerance**: Tolerates up to 2 node failures (f=2)

## 🎯 Features

### Banking Application
- Each client starts with balance = 10
- Transactions: `(sender, receiver, amount)`
- Clients send requests to leader node
- Responses: success/failure with insufficient funds handling

### Consensus (Stable-Leader Paxos)
- **Leader Election Phase**: PREPARE/ACK/NEW-VIEW with AcceptLog
- **Normal Operation**: REQUEST/ACCEPT/ACCEPTED/COMMIT cycle
- **Failure Handling**: Leader crash detection and new election
- **Recovery**: Catch-up mechanism for recovering nodes

### Print Functions
- `PrintLog(node)`: All messages handled by node
- `PrintDB(node)`: Current client balances
- `PrintStatus(seqNum)`: Status of sequence number (A/C/E/X)
- `PrintView()`: All NEW-VIEW messages exchanged

## 🧪 Testing

The system includes a comprehensive test suite with **45 tests** covering all aspects:

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests (32 tests)**:
   - Message serialization/deserialization
   - Paxos state management
   - Leader and backup functionality
   - Transaction parsing
   - Node initialization
   - Client management
   - Log merging algorithms

2. **Integration Tests (13 tests)**:
   - Leader election scenarios
   - Failure detection and recovery
   - Transaction execution ordering
   - End-to-end workflows
   - CSV processing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test categories
make test-unit
make test-integration
make test-basic

# Run with validation
make build
```

### Test Results
- **Total Tests**: 45
- **Success Rate**: 100% ✅
- **Coverage**: All major components and failure scenarios

## 📊 CSV Input Format

```csv
SetNumber,Transactions,LiveNodes
1,"(A,C,5),(C,E,4),(B,D,2)","[n1,n2,n3,n4,n5]"
2,"(A,E,4),(C,A,1)","[n1,n3,n5]"
```

- **SetNumber**: Test set identifier
- **Transactions**: Comma-separated transactions in format (sender,receiver,amount)
- **LiveNodes**: List of nodes that should be alive for this test set

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Node Communication
- Each node runs on ports 5001-5005
- Clients run on ports 8000-8004
- TCP sockets with JSON message serialization
- Heartbeat-based failure detection

### Paxos Algorithm
1. **Leader Election**:
   - PREPARE messages with view numbers
   - ACK responses with accept logs
   - NEW-VIEW messages with merged logs
   - Missing slots filled with no-ops

2. **Normal Operation**:
   - Client REQUEST to leader
   - Leader sends ACCEPT to all nodes
   - Nodes respond with ACCEPTED
   - Leader sends COMMIT after majority
   - Nodes execute in sequence order

3. **Failure Recovery**:
   - Heartbeat monitoring (2s interval, 6s timeout)
   - Leader failure triggers new election
   - Recovering nodes request catch-up
   - Log merging with status priorities

### Transaction Execution
- Transactions executed only when all lower sequence numbers are committed
- Atomic balance updates with insufficient funds checking
- Client responses sent after execution

## 🎮 Interactive Commands

When running `make demo`, you can use:

- `tx <sender> <receiver> <amount>` - Send transaction
- `fail <node_id>` - Simulate node failure
- `recover <node_id>` - Recover failed node
- `status <seq_num>` - Print status of sequence number
- `log <node_id>` - Print message log of node
- `db <node_id>` - Print database (balances) of node
- `view <node_id>` - Print NEW-VIEW messages of node
- `leader` - Show current leader
- `quit` - Exit interactive mode

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- No external dependencies (uses only standard library)
